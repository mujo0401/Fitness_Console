# Instructions for setting up the Spoonacular API

1. Create a free Spoonacular account at https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console#Dashboard
2. Get your API key from the API console
3. Add your API key to the .env file as SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
4. Also add it to the .env file as REACT_APP_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
5. Restart the backend and frontend servers

With this setup, the app will now fetch real dynamic ingredient data from the Spoonacular API
instead of using static mock data.
