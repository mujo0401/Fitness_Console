// This is a quick fix for the perpetual spinner issue
// We're going to modify the HeartTab.js file to immediately show mock data
// without waiting for API calls or error handling

1. The useEffect hook has been modified to directly create and use mock data
2. We've bypassed all the API calls and error handling logic
3. This is a temporary fix to determine if the issue is with API calls or rendering

To revert this change and go back to the proper implementation:
1. Uncomment the fetchHeartData() call in the useEffect hook
2. Comment out or remove the direct mock data generation code

This change should immediately show heart rate data without any API calls or waiting.
